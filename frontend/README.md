Authintic: AI-Powered Plagiarism Detector

Authintic is a comprehensive, full-stack application designed to detect plagiarism in text documents. It uses a sophisticated, multi-layered approach by combining a Node.js backend for user management, a Python/Flask microservice for AI-powered analysis, and a modern React frontend for user interaction.

This system is built to identify both direct copy-paste plagiarism and more advanced paraphrasing by leveraging sentence-level semantic embeddings and a high-speed vector search index.

Technology Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, react-router-dom

Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (with Mongoose), JWT (for authentication), Multer (for file uploads)

NLP Service: Python, Flask, Sentence-Transformers, FAISS, NLTK

External APIs: Google Gemini (for AI-powered rewrite suggestions)

Setup and Installation

Follow these steps precisely to run the project. You will need three separate terminals open to run the three services.

Prerequisites

Node.js: v18 or later

Python: v3.10 or later

Git: Latest version

MongoDB Account: A free MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Google Gemini API Key: A free API key from Google AI Studio.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd plagiarism-detector-project


Step 2: Set Up the NLP-Service (Terminal 1)

This service must be set up first, as it needs to generate data files before it can run.

Navigate to the nlp-service directory:

cd nlp-service


Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


CRITICAL: Create the source text directory:

mkdir source_texts


Add your source .txt files (e.g., article1.txt, wikipedia-page.txt) inside the source_texts/ folder. The quality of the detector depends on these files.

CRITICAL: Run the preprocessing script. This reads all your .txt files, creates embeddings, and builds the search index. You must run this before starting the app.

python preprocess_sources.py


Once preprocessing is complete, run the Flask server:

python app.py


This server will now be running at http://localhost:5001.

Step 3: Set Up the Backend (Terminal 2)

Open a new terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend


Install Node.js packages:

npm install


CRITICAL: Create a .env file in the backend/ directory:

touch .env


Open the .env file and add your secret keys. It must follow this format:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=thisisastrongsecretkeyforyourproject
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key


Run the Node.js server:

node server.js


This server will now be running at http://localhost:5000.

Step 4: Set Up the Frontend (Terminal 3)

Open a third terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend


Install Node.js packages:

npm install


Run the React development server:

npm start


Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000.

You can now register a new user, log in, and start uploading documents for analysis!

Our mission is to provide a powerful, intelligent, and easy-to-use tool for students, educators, and researchers to verify the originality of their work. We aim to combat the \"new era of plagiarism\" by developing a system that is smarter than the tools used to cheat it.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-2\">Our Technology</h2>\r\n                        <p className=\"mb-4\">\r\n                            This platform is more than just a simple text-matching tool.
